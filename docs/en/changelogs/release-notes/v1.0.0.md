# Release v1.0.0 — xNetVN MonitorD

Release Date: 2026-02-01

## Overview

xNetVN MonitorD v1.0.0 is the initial stable release of the lightweight host/service monitoring daemon. It provides a small, extensible framework for executing resource and service checks, and delivering notifications through multiple channels (email, Telegram, Discord). The project focuses on security, operational simplicity, and testability.

## Key Features ✅

- Resource monitoring (CPU, memory, disk) and service checks.
- Pluggable notifier architecture (Email, Telegram, Discord) with unit tests covering notifier integrations.
- Configuration via YAML and an example `.env` for runtime parameters.
- Systemd service files and sample deployment instructions for Linux environments.
- Comprehensive test suite and Sphinx-generated documentation.

## Security & Operations 🔒

- Never commit secrets (API keys, passwords) into the repository. Use environment variables or a proper secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, cloud KMS) instead.
- **Backup important configuration and environment files before upgrading.** Example paths used in deployment and documentation: `/opt/xnetvn_monitord/config/.env` and `/opt/xnetvn_monitord/config/main.yaml`. Store backups securely and rotate them following your operational practices.
- The service runs as a systemd unit in recommended deployments — adapt file paths and permissions to your environment.

## Tests & Compatibility 🔬

- Unit tests are provided for core checks and notifier integrations. Run the test suite with `pytest` during upgrades or before deployments.
- This release targets Python 3.10+ and standard Linux distributions. Follow the README for installation and systemd integration details.

## Known Limitations & Notes ⚠️

- Advanced integrations (e.g., Slack, metrics exporters) are not implemented in this initial release. Contributions welcome.
- If you run the daemon in containerized environments, ensure secrets are supplied via secret mounts or environment variables managed by the orchestrator.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to all contributors and the community for feedback and testing.
