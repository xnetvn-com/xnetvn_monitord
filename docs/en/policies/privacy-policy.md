## Privacy policy

## 1. Scope

The daemon primarily processes system data (CPU/RAM/Disk, service status). It does
not collect personal data by default.

## 2. Data that may appear in logs

- Service names, hostnames, system information.
- Do not log passwords/tokens.

## 3. Principles

- Collect only the data required for monitoring.
- Mask or filter sensitive information in notifications.

## 4. Responsibility

- Operators are responsible for configuring the daemon in line with internal policy.
