## API standards

The project **does not provide a public API** at the moment. If an API is introduced
in the future:

- Follow RESTful conventions with versioning `/api/v1`.
- Standardize responses and error codes.
- Require authentication/authorization for sensitive endpoints.
- Provide OpenAPI documentation and request/response examples.
