## GDPR compliance

## 1. Scope

The project does not collect personal data by default. However, if logs or alerts
contain PII, GDPR requirements apply.

## 2. Principles

- Data minimization: collect only necessary data.
- Data retention: define clear retention periods.
- Security by design.

## 3. Recommended actions

- Review logs to avoid storing PII.
- Establish a data deletion process on request.
