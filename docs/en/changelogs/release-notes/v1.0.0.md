## Release Notes v1.0.0

## Overview

The first release of xnetvn_monitord focuses on service and resource monitoring,
automatic recovery, and alerts.

## Key features

- Service monitoring with restart capability.
- Resource monitoring (CPU/RAM/Disk).
- Notifications via Email/Telegram/Slack/Discord/Webhook.
- Logging with rotation and PID file.

## Notes

- Metrics/health_check endpoints are not implemented in the current codebase.
- Before upgrading, back up configuration files and environment variables
	(for example: /opt/xnetvn_monitord/config/.env and /opt/xnetvn_monitord/config/main.yaml).
	Never commit sensitive data to the repository; use a secret manager if required.
