## Testing standards

## 1. Test pyramid

- Unit tests take the largest share.
- Integration tests cover monitoring flows.
- Security tests cover sensitive paths.

## 2. Rules

- Tests are independent and repeatable.
- Test names follow Given-When-Then.
- Add tests when fixing critical defects.

## 3. Tools

- pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-mock, freezegun.
