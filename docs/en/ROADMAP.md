## Roadmap

## Current status

The project already includes core features: service/resource monitoring, recovery, and
alerts via Email/Telegram/Slack/Discord/Webhook.

## Plans (under evaluation)

- Implement health check endpoints and metrics export.
- Improve hardening for systemd units.
- Strengthen operational documentation and runbooks.
- Add alert aggregation and deduplication strategies.

> Note: This is a reference direction. The official plan must be confirmed by the project team.
